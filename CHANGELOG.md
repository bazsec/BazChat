# BazChat changelog

## 010 — Fix: pressing "/" after /reload entered "//"

The v007 dedupe (only `SetText` when current text differs from target) wasn't fully covering Blizzard's deferred-text path. `ChatFrameUtil.OpenChat` stores `editbox.text = "/"` and `editbox.setText = 1`, then `ChatFrameEditBoxMixin:OnUpdate` applies the SetText on the next frame. Our hook ran synchronously and set the text immediately; on the next frame the `setText=1` path then ran `SetText(self.text)` *again*, and in some cursor states that produced "//".

Fix: clear `editbox.setText` and `editbox.text` on every BazChat editbox inside our `OpenChat` hook before applying our `SetText`. The deferred `OnUpdate` path can no longer fire a second SetText behind our back. We apply the text exactly once and own the result. Cursor position set to the end of the text so the user types where expected.

## 009 — Fix: UP arrow brought back the prefixed form ("/say hi") instead of raw input ("hi")

v008 added an `OnEnterPressed` pre-hook that captures the editbox's raw text before Blizzard's handler clears it. That alone is correct — but the pre-existing `AddHistoryLine` hook was still also capturing the *prefixed* form Blizzard's chat path passes ("/say hi" for a plain "hi" sent in say mode), so each user send produced two history entries: the raw text first, then the prefixed form. UP brought back the prefixed form (last entry).

Removed the `AddHistoryLine` hook entirely. The `OnEnterPressed` pre-hook captures slash commands too (the editbox text is "/dance" before Blizzard parses it), so we don't lose any capture path. UP now brings back exactly what the user typed.

## 008 — Fix: typed-input history not capturing new messages

Up-arrow chat history was loading saved entries from prior sessions but failing to add new messages typed in the current session. Existing capture went through three hooks (`C_ChatInfo.SendChatMessage`, legacy `SendChatMessage`, and per-editbox `AddHistoryLine`); recent Blizzard refactoring of the `ChatFrameEditBox` mixin tree appears to have moved methods around so that `hooksecurefunc` on the editbox instance silently no-ops in some cases.

Added a guaranteed pre-send capture in `History:Apply`: wrap the editbox's `OnEnterPressed` script so we read `self:GetText()` *before* Blizzard's handler clears it, then defer to the original. Idempotent (`_bcEnterHooked` flag) so it doesn't stack across re-applies. The other three hooks stay in place; `Add()` already de-dupes consecutive identical entries so multiple paths firing for the same message is harmless.

## 003 — Unified popup primitive

Replaced BazChat's two hand-rolled `StaticPopupDialogs` confirms with the new `BazCore:Confirm` primitive (BazCore v089). Both popups now match the rest of the BazCore UI — same fonts, buttons, backdrop — instead of inheriting Blizzard's default StaticPopup styling, which looked out of place sitting on top of a BazChat window.

- **Delete tab confirm** — right-click → Delete on any tab beyond General now uses the unified popup with a destructive (red) "Delete" button
- **Reset tabs confirm** — Tabs page → "Reset Tabs to Defaults" panic button uses the same primitive with a destructive "Reset" button

Requires BazCore 089+.

## 002 — Default settings tuned

Tuned the out-of-the-box defaults so the addon looks polished on first install rather than feeling like a wireframe. New users (and anyone who runs `/bc reset`) get:

- **`timestamps.format`** — `%I:%M %p` (12-hour AM/PM, no seconds) instead of `%H:%M:%S`
- **`windows[*].bgAlpha`** — `0.75` instead of `1.0` (slightly translucent so the world shows through behind the chat)
- **`windows[*].messageSpacing`** — `3` px instead of `0` (subtle inter-line gap for readability)
- **`windows[*].chromeFadeMode`** — `"always"` instead of `"off"` (unified bg+tabs visibility, both pinned to always-visible)

Existing users keep their current settings — these only apply to fresh installs or explicit resets.

## 001 — Initial release

Modern chat replacement for the Baz Suite, built on Blizzard's chat primitives — `ScrollingMessageFrame`, `ChatFrameMixin`, `ChatFrameEditBoxTemplate`, `TabSystemTemplate`. BazChat hides Blizzard's default chat windows and creates its own, owning the lifecycle, tabs, channel filtering, fade modes, persistence, and timestamp rendering end-to-end while preserving the standard message formatter, hyperlinks, edit-box history, BN whisper routing, and combat log.

### Tabs

- Default set: General, Guild, Trade, Log, plus a `+` button to create more
- Right-click any tab for the channel + rename + delete popup
- Hold-2s drag to reorder; order persists across `/reload`
- BazCore options page for tab management (rename, delete, edit channels, auto-show)
- Auto-show modes: Always, In a city, In a party, In a raid, In combat, In a battleground/arena, In a dungeon/raid

### Channel filtering

- Per-tab toggles for every chat category and every currently-joined channel
- 2-column popup with color-coded category labels
- Per-message channel-colored vertical gutter bar — green for guild, pink for whispers, yellow for system, custom-channel colors honored
- Bar colors update live when channel colors change via Blizzard's `/chat` config
- Channel notice rendering (Joined/Left/Changed Channel)
- Guild MOTD recovery on `/reload` + relog
- Tradeskill spam filter suppresses other players' "X creates Y" proximity broadcasts

### Two-column timestamps

- Left gutter rendering with channel-color bar
- Format dropdown: 24-hour, 24-hour with seconds, 12-hour, 12-hour with seconds
- Hover any timestamp for the full-date tooltip
- Wrap-aware: continuations align with message body, not under the timestamp
- Replayed history preserves the original capture time

### Persistent history

- 500 lines per tab saved across `/reload` + relog (configurable 100-2000)
- End-of-history separator clearly bracketed before live messages
- Channel-color and r/g/b preserved per line so the gutter bar reproduces correctly

### Channel name shortening

- `[Guild] → [g]`, `[Party Leader] → [pl]`, etc.
- Strips numeric prefix and zone suffix from custom channels: `[1. Trade - Stormwind] → [Trade]`
- Both behaviors independently toggleable
- Defaults match Prat / Chatter

### Copy chat

- Per-frame icon at the top-right corner of every chat window
- Last 500 visible lines pre-selected for `Ctrl+A` / `Ctrl+C`
- Color codes stripped for clean paste

### Auto-hide modes

- Per-element visibility (background, tabs, scrollbar): Always / On hover / On scroll / Never
- Unified background+tabs override

### Edit Mode integration

- Native `RegisterEditModeFrame` integration via BazCore
- Inline settings popup for opacity, scale, visibility modes
- Position nudge for pixel-precise placement

### Typed message history

- Up/Down arrows in the edit box cycle previous messages
- Persists across `/reload` and relog
- Captured at `C_ChatInfo.SendChatMessage`

### Slash commands

- `/bazchat` or `/bc` — open settings
- `/bc copy` — copy active tab
- `/bc clear` or `/clearchat` or `/cc` — clear active tab + history
- `/bc toggle` — master on/off
- `/bc reset` — wipe all settings

### Architecture

- Path B replica: Blizzard's default chat hidden, BazChat owns the windows from scratch
- `ChatFrameMixin` layered onto our frames so the formatter works natively
- `DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME` repointed to BazChat's General tab
- Standard chat dispatch and filter pipeline preserved — the standard hooks the game exposes for chat customization continue to work normally
- Built on the BazCore SettingsSpec API: one source of truth feeds both the Options page and the Edit Mode popup
